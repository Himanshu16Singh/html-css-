        short quotation.<q>To err is human</q> -Alexander Pope
        <p>
            Albert Einstein once said<hr><blockquote>
                The important thing is not to stop questioning.Curiosity has its own reason for<br>
                existence.One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of<br>
                eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality.It is enough if one tries merely to<br>
                comprehend a little of this mystery each day.
